## Analysis

The error message suggests that the program is failing to load the 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core.dll' module, which is needed by the program. The module is expected to be located in the directory 'C:\Users\THADDE~1\AppData\Local\Temp_MEI339082\azure\cognitiveservices\speech', but the program is not able to find it.
This issue is likely caused by the program being packaged using PyInstaller and not including all the necessary modules or dependencies. To resolve this issue, you should make sure that all the required dependencies are included when building the PyInstaller package.

Some possible solutions include:

Make sure that you have installed all the necessary dependencies for the program, and that they are included in the PyInstaller package.
Check that the path to the required module is correct and that it is included in the PyInstaller package.
Try rebuilding the PyInstaller package, making sure to include all the necessary modules and dependencies.
If the issue persists, you may need to consult the PyInstaller documentation or seek assistance from the PyInstaller community.
